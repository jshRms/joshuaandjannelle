        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          Our journey began in 2009 when we were just high school classmates,
          two young souls finding our way in the world. As the years passed,
          life led us down different paths, placing us in separate sections and
          eventually taking us in different directions. Fate, however, had other
          plans.<br /><br />In February 2019, our paths crossed again,
          rekindling a bond that had been waiting to bloom. From that moment on,
          we shared everything—laughter, deep conversations, personal struggles,
          and even the occasional arguments. Somewhere along the way, Joshua
          realized his heart had found its home, and for five months, he
          patiently courted Jannelle Alyssah, hoping she would see in him what
          he saw in her. Then, on July 6, 2019, she said
          <span>yes</span>.<br /><br />
          six years, we have walked hand in hand through life's highs and lows.
          We have faced challenges that tested our strength, endured pain that
          made us question everything, and even stood at the edge of giving up.
          But through it all, love remained our anchor. We chose each other,
          again and again, fighting for what we knew was worth it. Our story is
          one of resilience, growth, and unwavering love—a testament to the
          power of two hearts determined to stay together.

        <h2>The Proposal</h2>

        </div>
        <p>
          After six years of pure love, honesty, and unwavering commitment,
          Joshua knew it was time to take the next step—a step that would define
          the rest of their lives. In August 2024, he made the most thrilling
          and nerve-wracking decision of his life. Despite the lingering fear of
          rejection, he pushed past his doubts, driven by the love he held for
          Jannelle Alyssah.<br /><br />With a heart pounding in both excitement
          and anticipation, he got down on one knee, his eyes filled with
          sincerity and hope. Time seemed to stand still as he asked the most
          important question he had ever spoken—asking Jannelle Alyssah to be
          his forever.<br /><br />
          For a moment, the world faded into silence. The air was electric with
          emotion, a mix of excitement, joy, and an indescribable feeling
          neither of them had ever known before. And then, in a moment that felt
          like pure magic, she smiled through happy tears and spoke the words
          that Joshua had been longing to hear.<br /><br /><span class="i-do"
            >YES! I DO!</span
          ><br /><br />With those words, their love story took a new turn—a
          promise sealed with pure happiness, a journey towards forever.
